# SomtTools v0.0.1 Release Note

## Overview
I am pleased to announce the release of SomtTools v0.0.1. This version represents the first commit of the project, where I have added the initial HTML page and the structure for a list of tools embedded in a static HTML site. One of the tools included is the EUC-KR to UTF8 converter, which utilizes the `FileReader` to convert the encoding of input files to UTF8.

## Future Plans
For future releases, I have planned the following changes:
- Adding a more refined visual appearance through CSS redesign.
- Incorporating additional tools such as a subtitle converter and a subtitle resyncer.
